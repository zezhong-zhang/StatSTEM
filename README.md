# StatSTEM

The open-source StatSTEM software provides a user-friendly way of quantifying atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images by using parametric model-based fitting. In this manner, accurate and precise quantitative information can be extracted about the material under investigation. The software is written in the MATLAB computer language and runs for several MATLAB versions and operating systems (pc, mac, linux).

In StatSTEM, electron microscopy images are modelled by a superposition of Gaussian peaks describing each individual atomic column. Hereby, overlap of intensities from neighbouring columns is taken into account. Structural parameters, like column positions and scattering cross-sections, are determined and can be used for further analyses, such as atom counting, strain measurements, and creating 3D structural models.

The software is developed by the team of Sandra Van Aert at EMAT, University of Antwerp, Belgium.
